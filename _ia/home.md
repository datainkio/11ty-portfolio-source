statement:
  introduction: "A digital creative with 20+ years of award-winning work"
  approach: "I work with user researchers, designers, and developers to deliver digital products and services. I approach design challenges from a systems perspective, using ethnographic methods of inquiry to uncover the common thread connecting patterns of human behavior."
  background: "My approach to UX design is rooted in social anthropology. As a student I explored the ongoing dialog between language, tool use, and human behavior. Those years spent studying the interrelationships between different models of the human being continue to shape my values and methods as a designer today."
  activities: "Today, as a design lead, I spend as much time thinking about UI pixels and UX flows as I do sitting in workshops and boardrooms, discussing clients’ needs, technical constraints, product strategy, and business objectives. I encourage my teams to play, remix, and look at things sideways—using customer and business insights, brand, storytelling, and human centered design to deliver award-winning digital design solutions."
