  <h1>Work</h1>

    I am a lucky guy. In my 20+ years designing and building digital products and services I have worked with museums,
    artists, scientists, hospitals, banks, schools, global brands, and even the federal government. Each project brings a unique set of challenges and puzzles to solve, and I thrive on finding solutions shaped by a focus on human-centered design.</p>
