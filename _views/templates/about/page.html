			My education is in social anthropology. As a student I explored the ongoing dialog between language, tool use, and
			human behavior. Those years spent studying the interrelationships between different models of the human being continue
			to shape my values and methods as a designer.

		As a design lead, I spend as much time sweating UI pixels and UX flows
		as I do sitting in workshops and boardrooms, discussing clients' user needs, technical
		constraints, product strategy, and business objectives.
	</p>
	<p class="text-neutral-200">
		I am often hands-on encouraging my teams to play, remix, and look at things sideways -
		using customer and business insights, brand, storytelling, and human-centered design to
		create products and services that meet real human needs.
