			My education is in social anthropology. As a student I explored how the
			relationship between language and tool use shapes human behavior and
			social structure. By analyzing how we describe and change the world around
			us, I uncovered how these elements influence societal norms and
			relationships.
		</p>
		<p>
			Those years spent studying the interrelationships between scientific
			models of the human being continue to shape my values and methodology as a
			designer by emphasizing a holistic understanding of human behavior.

			Today, as a visual creative, I'm often hands on encouraging teams to play,
			remix, and look at things sidewaysâ€”using customer and business insights,
			brand, storytelling, and human centered design to create differentiated
			products. I spend as much time sweating UI pixels and UX flows as I do
			sitting in workshops and boardrooms, discussing client's user needs,
			technical constraints, product strategy, and business objectives.

			I apply this expertise across a wide range of domains, delivering solutions
			for global brands, museums, artists, musicians, hospitals, schools, and even
			the federal government. The audiences and business goals change, but the
			priority of maintaining focus on human-centered design remains constant.
		</p>

			It is work with a real impact. As the design manager for federal projects
			with Bixal, my teams and I increased equitable access to federal benefits
			and services for 330 million Americans, connected small businesses with $4.2
			billion in funding, helped reduce the number of annual cases of foodborne
			illness by 7 million, and helped establish the United States Web Design
			System. As a developer and product designer with IBM Interactive, I led the
			design for the company's first application of Watson AI to healthcare,
			helped design and build both the world's first global platform for
			democratizing access to pediatric expertise, and helped design and build the
			first platform uniting urban data from cities across the globe.

			You can see my contributions in the questions researchers ask, the
			strategies that lead designers to solutions, and the human perspective that
			helps engineers realize what is possible. As a human-experience designer, I
			serve as the common thread on multifunctional teams, integrating diverse
			insights into a cohesive vision. My focus on user-centric design ensures
			that every team member is aligned with the end goal of creating meaningful,
			intuitive experiences. By facilitating communication and understanding
			across different functions, I help translate complex technical requirements
			into user-friendly solutions, driving innovation and ensuring that the final
			product resonates deeply with its intended audience.
