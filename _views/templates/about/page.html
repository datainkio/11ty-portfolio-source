			My education is in social anthropology. As a student I explored the ongoing dialog between language, tool use, and
			human behavior. Those years spent studying the interrelationships between different models of the human being continue
			to shape my values and methods as a designer.

			Today I think in terms of systems, information flows, and decision-making.
