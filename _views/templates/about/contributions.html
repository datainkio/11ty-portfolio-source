    <p>UX can't always be measured in pixels.</p>
    <p class="text-neutral-200">
        As a design lead, I spend as much time sweating how things look and move
        as I do sitting in workshops and boardrooms, discussing clients' user needs, technical
        constraints, product strategy, and business objectives.
    </p>
    <p class="text-neutral-200">
        I am often hands-on encouraging my teams to play, remix, and look at things sideways -
        using customer and business insights, brand, storytelling, and human-centered design to
        create products and services that meet real human needs.
