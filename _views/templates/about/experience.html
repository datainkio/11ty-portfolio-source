        Good digital experience design doesn't just happen. It comes from a deep understanding of how and why
        people do what they do and connecting this with business goals.

        I work closely with user researchers to identify key questions and hypotheses that reveal critical 
        insights into human behavior. These insights directly shape the design strategies I develop, guiding 
        designers toward more impactful solutions. By bringing a nuanced human perspective, I help engineers 
        translate possibilities into tangible outcomes.
